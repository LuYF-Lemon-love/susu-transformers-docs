## 100 projects using Transformers

Transformers is more than a toolkit to use pretrained models: it's a community of projects built around it and the
Hugging Face Hub. We want Transformers to enable developers, researchers, students, professors, engineers, and anyone
else to build their dream projects.

In order to celebrate the 100,000 stars of transformers, we have decided to put the spotlight on the
community, and we have created the [awesome-transformers](./awesome-transformers.md) page which lists 100
incredible projects built in the vicinity of transformers.

If you own or use a project that you believe should be part of the list, please open a PR to add it!

197. Want to contribute a new model? We have added a **detailed guide and templates** to guide you in the process of adding a new model. You can find them in the [`templates`](./templates) folder of the repository. Be sure to check the [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and contact the maintainers or open an issue to collect feedback before starting your PR.

To check if each model has an implementation in Flax, PyTorch or TensorFlow, or has an associated tokenizer backed by the ü§ó Tokenizers library, refer to [this table](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index#supported-frameworks).

These implementations have been tested on several datasets (see the example scripts) and should match the performance of the original implementations. You can find more details on performance in the Examples section of the [documentation](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples).
